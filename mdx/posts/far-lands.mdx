I'm currently working on the new Boreal Heights album. Although the work is
still in progress, I decided to share a single from the upcoming release called
_Far Lands._ This isn't the first song I recorded for the album, but I chose to
share it because it captures the authentic atmosphere and mood I want to convey
in the final release. The final version of _Far Lands_ might undergo some
changes, but I'm not certain yet because I really like it as it is.

The idea for _Far Lands_ came to me while composing an old "memories" post on my
blog a few months ago, while listening to _Eventide_ by Eneferens. I began to
think it might be a good idea to create a spiritual successor to my previously
released EPs, _Under Ã…pen Himmel_ and _Beyond the Sea of Ghosts._

As for the rest of the album, the work is ongoing. At this point, I've managed
to complete more than half of the tracks. I'm planning to release the album
sometime in the autumn.

Recorded and mixed from March to May 2019. Engineered, mixed, and produced by
Evgenii Grigorev.
