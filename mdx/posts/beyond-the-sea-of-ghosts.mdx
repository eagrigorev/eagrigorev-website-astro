Five years have passed since my first Boreal Heights release, _Crystal Maze._
For this EP, I composed the song "Beyond the Sea of Ghosts" in two versions:
acoustic and metal. I originally published the metal version and left the
acoustic one in drafts, thinking it would stay there. But now, I believe it's
time to share it with the world! Today, I'm excited to present my new single,
_Beyond the Sea of Ghosts._

I'm still quite satisfied with the genre I explored in my previous EP, so
_Beyond the Sea of Ghosts_ is also rooted in dark folk. For this release, I
experimented with ambient sounds for the first time, opening up a vast field of
possibilities for future exploration!

Although _Beyond the Sea of Ghosts_ has been reworked and rearranged, it remains
the same song at its core. I made some adjustments to make it playable on
acoustic guitar. Arranging songs initially meant for metal on various acoustic
instruments is always challenging, and sometimes it's not worth the effort, but
I'm confident that this process worked well for this song!

Recorded and mixed from May to June 2018. Engineered, mixed, and produced by
Evgenii Grigorev.
