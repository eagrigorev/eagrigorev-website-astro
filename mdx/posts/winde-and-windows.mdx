I'm excited to announce the release of the new Boreal Heights album, _Winds &
Windows._ I spent just over a year composing, recording, and re-recording these
songs. The project began with acoustic guitars only, but I later expanded the
instrumentation to include bass guitar, flute, and piano. However, the original
guitar-only singles are still available in various places. I've never been one
to follow trends; I've always wanted to create music that I personally enjoy
listening to, and I'm thrilled that others find it interesting as well! If
Boreal Heights songs resonate with you, then all my efforts have been
worthwhile.
