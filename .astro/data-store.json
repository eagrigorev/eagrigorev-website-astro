It was\nonly a two-day trip to complete all the formalities for our UK visa application,\nbut it was our first real trip to Athens in almost three years of living in\nGreece. I'll share a few pictures from that trip later.\n\nI remember we had a very cozy and quiet little apartment with a kitchen window\nthat looked out onto an overgrown and slightly abandoned garden. One day it was\nraining, which is common for Greece in the winter, and I was doing dishes in our\nquiet little kitchen, looking outside. I saw how the water pelted the leaves and\nbarrels. I also saw a cat hiding under a staircase and thought that this might\nbe one of those core memories that stay with you for a lifetime.\n\nI thought about my pilgrimage: how the \"me\" from 2021 would have never imagined\nmyself doing household chores in Athens. I grieved all the things I had lost and\nall the people who were no longer there.\n\nFor the last few years, I've been reading a lot of various small, personal\nwebsites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the internet when\npeople could create small pieces of the web for themselves, and all the websites\nlooked authentic and different. I thought it might be a good idea to create\nsomething like that for myself and share things that I do care about and which\nare already gone.\n\nI was thinking all these thoughts while doing dishes. The rain was pouring, the\ncat was sitting, and all the small, precious things around me and inside my\nstrange life were connecting to each other. The cat eventually left and the rain\nstopped, but the warm feeling inside me lingered for a while. I can still bring\nit back to life sometimes.","src/content/posts/a-kitchen-in-athens.mdx",[28],"@images/a-kitchen-in-athens.jpg","37b4cb3328f85bf0",true,"exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens",{"id":31,"data":33,"body":41,"filePath":42,"assetImports":43,"digest":45,"deferredRender":30},{"title":34,"slug":31,"datePublished":35,"excerpt":36,"image":37,"tags":40},"Exploring the Acropolis of Athens","August 14, 2025","That winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost summer heat.

This was\nour first proper visit to Greece's capital, and I felt a little sorry we\ncouldn't have come sooner. Before that, we had a five-hour train ride from\nThessaloniki, during which I worked and read a book. The trip reminded me of my\nchildhood journeys to the countryside with my parents. It felt almost the same\nto take the train and stare aimlessly at the changing landscape. I'm glad that\nsome things never change.\n\n\u003CImageGallery\n  srcLeft={img2}\n  captionLeft=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n  srcRight={img3}\n  captionRight=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n/>\n\nThat winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost\nsummer heat. Since we didn't have much time, we decided to visit the Acropolis,\nhave dinner, and maybe take a short walk around the city center. I don't really\nlike to use the word, but the Acropolis was \"epic.\" I felt pressed down to the\nground by the history of that place. Ancient ruins hold a special place in my\nheart. Even with all the cameras and technology, you can still feel the\natmosphere of distant times around those still marble blocks and statues.\n\nAthens is a huge city. I almost forgot what it feels like to spend an hour or\nmore just to get from point A to point B, and Athens reminded me of that. I\nenjoyed using the metro in Athens. Noisy and overcrowded, it still felt quiet\nand relaxing. Dilapidated bridges over the rails covered with rust and paint,\novergrown walls bathed in sun, and narrow passages and walkways. I don't think\nI've ever seen a place before where nature and technology are so intertwined\nwith the old and neglected.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption\n  src={img4}\n  alt=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n  caption=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n/>\n\nA few months later, when my phone finally realized I was in Athens, I started\nreceiving Instagram ads for a bookshop. The atmosphere of these ads was almost\nthe same as the Athens underground: full of sun, stillness, and relaxation. I\nguess next time I visit, I'll have no other choice but to find that bookshop.","src/content/posts/exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens.mdx",[44],"@images/exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens/featured.jpg","fbaf3b49ea091055","norwegian-church-at-cardiff-bay-in-march",{"id":46,"data":48,"body":57,"filePath":58,"assetImports":59,"digest":61,"deferredRender":30},{"title":49,"slug":46,"datePublished":50,"excerpt":51,"image":52,"tags":54},"Norwegian Church at Cardiff Bay in March","August 17, 2025","A few months later, in cold and windy Cardiff, Wales, we stumbled upon the old Norwegian Church Arts Centre, nestled in the heart of Cardiff Bay.

After a couple of years living in Greece, our\nbodies had adapted to the heat and had forgotten how to handle cold weather. It\nmight not have even been that cold, but the wind from the bay sent chills\nthrough us. We immediately decided to go inside and warm up for a while.\n\n[Inside](https://www.norwegianchurchcardiff.com/), it was toasty. The barista was so friendly and the atmosphere so happy\nthat I was instantly transported back to two trips from my \"past life\" â€” one\nfrom 11 years ago, and another from the year after. Both trips held dear,\npleasant memories, but they were also incredibly sad. If I didn't know that a\nhuman body completely replaces its cells every seven to ten years, I wouldn't\nhave believed they had even happened to me.\n\nThe first trip, to Finland and Sweden, felt like the beginning of something new\nand exciting, but it was actually the end. It took me almost eight years to cope\nand reinvent myself from scratch. Though, keeping the seven-year theory in mind,\nevery cell that had suffered was likely gone, and I was, in a sense, a new\nperson. I sat on a wooden bench, drinking a coffee, and thinking about the past.\nI had only started drinking coffee again a year or so ago, after almost ten\nyears of abstinence. Honestly, I had hated coffee since that trip, but I learned\nto love it again.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption\n  src={img2}\n  alt=\"Into the sea\"\n  caption=\"I believe that one was taken in 2014, but it might as well be from the second trip\"\n/>\n\nThe second trip was to Ã…land. I went alone, just to see what it would feel like\nto experience the same conditions again after a whole year of pain. It was a\nterrible experience. The trip itself was fine, but I felt awful. I haven't\ntraveled alone since. Still, I cherish the memories of eating fish soup by the\nriver at an old fisherman's house and exploring Mariehamn in the evening,\nwatching a sunrise and a sunset from the top of a hill. I remember going to a\nrandom pub for supper and watching a guy get kicked out for being drunk and\nshattering a beer glass. Then, on the steps of a church almost identical to the\none I'd seen the year before, where I'd once thought I was having the best day\nof my life, I felt I was having the worst. I cried for all the things I could\nhave had but had lost, and it felt liberating, even though it wasn't.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption\n  src={img3}\n  alt=\"Hills of Mariehamn\"\n  caption=\"Hills of Mariehamn, 2015\"\n/>\n\nA quote on the wall caught my attention. I usually dislike such things, but this\none triggered memories so intensely that I almost cried again. I recalled both\ntrips with a clarity I usually tended to avoid. I experienced all the emotions\nagain. It was so strange to feel the same way after more than ten years, but I\nwas glad that even though I was older, I could still think, feel, and experience\nthings as before. It meant that the young, silly boy inside me hadn't died or\ngone into a dark room but was wandering in the fields instead. This was a\nrelief, and I'm glad I had that realization and have held onto it.\n\n\u003CBlockquote quote={`You can't go back and change the beginning but you can start where you are and change the ending.`} author='C.S. Lewis' />\n\nAnd then we left. The day was long, we had things to see, and it was still only\nmorning. God, I was so tired.","src/content/posts/norwegian-church-at-cardiff-bay-in-march.mdx",[60],"@images/norwegian-church-at-cardiff-bay-in-march/featured.jpg","84e568c7393f5c5a"]
