It was\nonly a two-day trip to complete all the formalities for our UK visa application,\nbut it was our first real trip to Athens in almost three years of living in\nGreece. I'll share a few pictures from that trip later.\n\nI remember we had a very cozy and quiet little apartment with a kitchen window\nthat looked out onto an overgrown and slightly abandoned garden. One day it was\nraining, which is common for Greece in the winter, and I was doing dishes in our\nquiet little kitchen, looking outside. I saw how the water pelted the leaves and\nbarrels. I also saw a cat hiding under a staircase and thought that this might\nbe one of those core memories that stay with you for a lifetime.\n\nI thought about my pilgrimage: how the \"me\" from 2021 would have never imagined\nmyself doing household chores in Athens. I grieved all the things I had lost and\nall the people who were no longer there.\n\nFor the last few years, I've been reading a lot of various small, personal\nwebsites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the internet when\npeople could create small pieces of the web for themselves, and all the websites\nlooked authentic and different. I thought it might be a good idea to create\nsomething like that for myself and share things that I do care about and which\nare already gone.\n\nI was thinking all these thoughts while doing dishes. The rain was pouring, the\ncat was sitting, and all the small, precious things around me and inside my\nstrange life were connecting to each other. The cat eventually left and the rain\nstopped, but the warm feeling inside me lingered for a while. I can still bring\nit back to life sometimes.","src/content/posts/a-kitchen-in-athens.mdx",[191],"@images/a-kitchen-in-athens.jpg","1e5616a7c6065f1f",true,"exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens",{"id":194,"data":196,"body":204,"filePath":205,"assetImports":206,"digest":208,"deferredRender":193},{"title":197,"slug":194,"datePublished":198,"excerpt":199,"image":200,"tags":203},"Exploring the Acropolis of Athens","August 14, 2025","That winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost summer heat.

Before that, we had a five-hour train ride from\nThessaloniki, during which I worked and read a book. The trip reminded me of my\nchildhood journeys to the countryside with my parents.

I don't really\nlike to use the word, but the Acropolis was \"epic.\" I felt pressed down to the\nground by the history of that place. Ancient ruins hold a special place in my\nheart. Even with all the cameras and technology, you can still feel the\natmosphere of distant times around those still marble blocks and statues.\n\nAthens is a huge city. I almost forgot what it feels like to spend an hour or\nmore just to get from point A to point B, and Athens reminded me of that. I\nenjoyed using the metro in Athens. Noisy and overcrowded, it still felt quiet\nand relaxing. Dilapidated bridges over the rails covered with rust and paint,\novergrown walls bathed in sun, and narrow passages and walkways.

Though at first sight some houses looked decrepit, it was clear that\nthey were tended to and kept as close as possible to how they looked when they\nwere built. After a walk in the village, we went into the hills. Shrub walls\nbecame higher, hiding farms and livestock, and the air smelled of horses and cut\ngrass.

After a couple of years living in Greece, our\nbodies had adapted to the heat and had forgotten how to handle cold weather. It\nmight not have even been that cold, but the wind from the bay sent chills\nthrough us. We immediately decided to go inside and warm up for a while.\n\n[Inside](https://www.norwegianchurchcardiff.com/), it was toasty. The barista\nwas so friendly and the atmosphere so happy that I was instantly transported\nback to two trips from my \"past life\" — one from 11 years ago, and another from\nthe year after. Both trips held dear, pleasant memories, but they were also\nincredibly sad. If I didn't know that a human body completely replaces its cells\nevery seven to ten years, I wouldn't have believed they had even happened to me.\n\nThe first trip, to Finland and Sweden, felt like the beginning of something new\nand exciting, but it was actually the end. It took me almost eight years to cope\nand reinvent myself from scratch. Though, keeping the seven-year theory in mind,\nevery cell that had suffered was likely gone, and I was, in a sense, a new\nperson. I sat on a wooden bench, drinking a coffee, and thinking about the past.\nI had only started drinking coffee again a year or so ago, after almost ten\nyears of abstinence. Honestly, I had hated coffee since that trip, but I learned\nto love it again.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption\n  src={img2}\n  caption=\"I believe that one was taken in 2014, but it might as well be from the second trip\"\n/>\n\nThe second trip was to Åland. I went alone, just to see what it would feel like\nto experience the same conditions again after a whole year of pain. It was a\nterrible experience. The trip itself was fine, but I felt awful. I haven't\ntraveled alone since. Still, I cherish the memories of eating fish soup by the\nriver at an old fisherman's house and exploring Mariehamn in the evening,\nwatching a sunrise and a sunset from the top of a hill. I remember going to a\nrandom pub for supper and watching a guy get kicked out for being drunk and\nshattering a beer glass. Then, on the steps of a church almost identical to the\none I'd seen the year before, where I'd once thought I was having the best day\nof my life, I felt I was having the worst. I cried for all the things I could\nhave had but had lost, and it felt liberating, even though it wasn't.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption src={img3} caption=\"Hills of Mariehamn, 2015\" />\n\nA quote on the wall caught my attention. I usually dislike such things, but this\none triggered memories so intensely that I almost cried again. I recalled both\ntrips with a clarity I usually tended to avoid. I experienced all the emotions\nagain. It was so strange to feel the same way after more than ten years, but I\nwas glad that even though I was older, I could still think, feel, and experience\nthings as before. It meant that the young, silly boy inside me hadn't died or\ngone into a dark room but was wandering in the fields instead. This was a\nrelief, and I'm glad I had that realization and have held onto it.\n\n\u003CBlockquote\n  quote={`You can't go back and change the beginning but you can start where you are and change the ending.`}\n  author=\"C.S.

Feel free\nto fork it and explore!\n\n## Technologies\n\nI used TypeScript and the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework as the core,\nwith native HTML and JavaScript for the front end. I really like Astro because\nit allows me to organize the website structure without much effort spent on\nrouting and redirects. It's also very fast, serving pre-rendered pages with\nalmost zero load on the user side. The website is deployed on\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/), with automatic deployments pulled directly from\nthe master branch on GitHub. This is likely the only pipeline I use; everything\nelse is fairly manual, but I enjoy having control over every step of the\npublishing process.\n\n## Design\n\nI also did the design and prototyping myself. The current design is a tribute to\nmy two favorite WordPress themes: Stills and Narrator by\n[Paul Povoroznuk](https://www.instagram.com/ppovoroznuk/). Responsiveness is\nhandled by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) scripts, which use clamp technology to\ncontinuously recalculate font sizes and spacing relative to the user's screen\nsize. This keeps the proportions consistent and ensures the website looks good\non all devices.\n\n## Fonts and Animations\n\nThe website uses Hanken Grotesk by [Hanken Design Co.](https://hanken.co/) I\nprefer clean and uncluttered interfaces, so I only use the bare minimum of\nvanilla JavaScript animations.\n\n## Writing\n\nMy CMS consists of a collection of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files. MDX is an\nextended markdown format that allows the use of custom components and features.\nEach MDX file has a meta section containing information about the post or page,\nwhich is then read and converted into props for different components and pages.","src/content/pages/colophon.mdx","23e68c5d4aa4db9a","reading-journal",{"id":250,"data":252,"body":255,"filePath":256,"digest":257,"deferredRender":193},{"title":253,"slug":250,"datePublished":254},"Reading Journal",["Date","2025-08-27T21:00:00.000Z"],"import BookGrid from '@components/BookGrid.astro';\n\nI began filling in the blank pages on May 14, the day I turned 23.

Before transitioning to software, I spent 10 years as a\nmilitary engineer and, prior to that, worked as a bookseller. I have a passion\nfor clean and minimal interfaces, accessible web applications, and digital\ngardens.\n\nI was born in Saint Petersburg and received my master's degree in Automation and\nEngineering in 2010 from Baltic State Technological University. Over the years,\nI began to burn out on engineering as my interest in web development grew. This\nled me to start learning software development during the COVID years. In 2022, I\nmoved to Turkey, then to Latvia, and later to Greece, where I landed my first IT\njob.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking, calisthenics, drawing, playing guitar, reading,\nand film photography.","src/content/pages/about.mdx","e7432d893247a3bb","privacy-and-security",{"id":266,"data":268,"body":271,"filePath":272,"digest":273,"deferredRender":193},{"title":269,"slug":266,"datePublished":270},"Privacy & Security",["Date","2025-08-22T21:00:00.000Z"],"Last Updated: August 23, 2025\n\nWelcome to our website.

I visited England for the second time in the last six months\nbefore my visa expired and took a lot of photos. I'm mostly programming and\nplaying guitar these days. I started playing again recently after almost a year\nof staying away from my guitar. I'm glad that I can find inspiration again.\n\n## October 2024\n\nOctober marked two years since I moved to Greece. There were both highs and\nlows, but mostly highs. I've never felt so much purpose in my life or in what\nI'm doing. I also had the chance to see my mother. She spent a couple of weeks\nwith me, and we could finally discuss everything in person. Unfortunately, my\nfather wasn't able to join us this year, but hopefully I'll see them both again\nnext year. After six months of studying, I finally got my driving license! I'm\nnot sure when I'll take my first trip, but hopefully I won't forget all the\nskills I learned.\n\n## August 2024\n\nAfter two months of studying driving theory, I finally started taking lessons.\nThe idea of driving has always made me anxious — and still does — but after a\nfew lessons, I'm already feeling more comfortable. It even seems like I might\nsoon be ready to embark on my first adventure!\n\n## May 2024\n\nI began learning driving theory. After years of hesitation, I feel that I'm\nfinally ready to become more mobile and less reliant on buses. Depending on\npublic transportation has been a pretty exhausting experience.\n\n## January 2024\n\nI resumed working on my website. I decided to rewrite everything from scratch\nand implement a new design. It took me quite a while to come up with something,\nbut at least the process has started. I'm also continuing my weekly calisthenics\ntraining that I began at the end of November. My body hurts almost constantly,\nbut I enjoy the workouts.\n\nI've been reading Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto. Last year, I started\nre-reading everything I could get my hands on, and I plan to continue doing that\nthis year.","src/content/pages/now.mdx","4574ee66569f1e0a","readingArchive",["Map",284,285,291,292,298,299,305,306,312,313,319,320,326,327,333,334,340,341,347,348,354,355,361,362,368,369,375,376,382,383],"2010",{"id":284,"data":286,"body":288,"filePath":289,"digest":290,"deferredRender":193},{"title":284,"slug":284,"datePublished":287},["Date","2010-12-30T22:00:00.000Z"],"This year, I read 45 books and discovered 25 new authors.\n\n## December\n\nDecember 30, 2010 _Fight Club: A Novel_ by Chuck Palahniuk (1996)\n\nDecember 29, 2010 _Les Quatre vies du saule_ by Shan Sa (1999)\n\nDecember 28, 2010 _La pell freda_ by Albert Sánchez Piñol (2002)\n\nDecember 25, 2010 _Last Go Round: A Real Western_ by Ken Kesey, Ken Babbs (1994)\n\nDecember 22, 2010 _Ein Regenschirm für diesen Tag_ by Wilhelm Genazino (2001)\n\nDecember 20, 2010 _My Life_ by Bill Clinton (2004)\n\nDecember 1, 2010 _Nine Stories_ by J.
