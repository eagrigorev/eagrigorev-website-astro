It is open-source and available on my\n[GitHub](https://github.com/eagrigorev/eagrigorev-website-astro) page. Feel free to\nfork it and explore!\n\n## Technologies\n\nI used TypeScript and the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework as the core,\nwith vanilla JavaScript and HTML for the front end. I really like Astro because it allows me to organize the website structure without much effort spent on routing and\nredirects. It's also very fast, serving pre-rendered pages with almost zero load on the user side. The website is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), with\nautomatic deployments pulled directly from the master branch on GitHub. This is\nlikely the only pipeline I use; everything else is fairly manual, but I enjoy\nhaving control over every step of the publishing process.\n\n## Design\n\nI also did the design and prototyping myself. The current design is a tribute to\nmy two favorite WordPress themes: Stills and Narrator by\n[Paul Povoroznuk](https://www.instagram.com/ppovoroznuk/). Responsiveness is\nhandled by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) scripts, which use clamp technology to\ncontinuously recalculate font sizes and spacing relative to the user's screen\nsize. This keeps the proportions consistent and ensures the website looks good\non all devices.\n\n## Fonts and Animations\n\nThe website uses Hanken Grotesk by [Hanken Design Co.](https://hanken.co/) I prefer clean\nand uncluttered interfaces, so I only use the bare minimum of vanilla JavaScript\nanimations. Icons by [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/).\n\n## Writing\n\nMy CMS consists of a collection of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files. MDX is an\nextended markdown format that allows the use of custom components and features.\nEach MDX file has a meta section containing information about the post or page,\nwhich is then read and converted into props for different components and pages.\n\n\u003CEmbedImage\n  src={oldWebsitePreview}\n  description=\"This is the old version of my website.\"\n/>\n\nThe [previous](https://github.com/eagrigorev/eagrigorev-website-nextjs/) version of this website was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), but it was a little bit overkill for such a small project.
