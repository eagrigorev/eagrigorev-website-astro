I originally published the metal version and left the\r\nacoustic one in drafts, thinking it would stay there. But now, I believe it's\r\ntime to share it with the world! Today, I'm excited to present my new single,\r\n_Beyond the Sea of Ghosts._\r\n\r\nI'm still quite satisfied with the genre I explored in my previous EP, so\r\n_Beyond the Sea of Ghosts_ is also rooted in dark folk. For this release, I\r\nexperimented with ambient sounds for the first time, opening up a vast field of\r\npossibilities for future exploration!\r\n\r\nAlthough _Beyond the Sea of Ghosts_ has been reworked and rearranged, it remains\r\nthe same song at its core. I made some adjustments to make it playable on\r\nacoustic guitar. Arranging songs initially meant for metal on various acoustic\r\ninstruments is always challenging, and sometimes it's not worth the effort, but\r\nI'm confident that this process worked well for this song!\r\n\r\nRecorded and mixed from May to June 2018. Engineered, mixed, and produced by\r\nEvgenii Grigorev.\r\n\r\nArtwork by Ruslan Valeev via Unsplash.","mdx/posts/beyond-the-sea-of-ghosts.mdx",[84],"src/images/featured-images/beyond-the-sea-of-ghosts.jpg","7ebbcd5a40be49f5"]
