It was\nonly a two-day trip to complete all the formalities for our UK visa application,\nbut it was our first real trip to Athens in almost three years of living in\nGreece. I'll share a few pictures from that trip later.\n\nI remember we had a very cozy and quiet little apartment with a kitchen window\nthat looked out onto an overgrown and slightly abandoned garden. One day it was\nraining, which is common for Greece in the winter, and I was doing dishes in our\nquiet little kitchen, looking outside. I saw how the water pelted the leaves and\nbarrels. I also saw a cat hiding under a staircase and thought that this might\nbe one of those core memories that stay with you for a lifetime.\n\nI thought about my pilgrimage: how the \"me\" from 2021 would have never imagined\nmyself doing household chores in Athens. I grieved all the things I had lost and\nall the people who were no longer there.\n\nFor the last few years, I've been reading a lot of various small, personal\nwebsites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the internet when\npeople could create small pieces of the web for themselves, and all the websites\nlooked authentic and different. I thought it might be a good idea to create\nsomething like that for myself and share things that I do care about and which\nare already gone.\n\nI was thinking all these thoughts while doing dishes. The rain was pouring, the\ncat was sitting, and all the small, precious things around me and inside my\nstrange life were connecting to each other. The cat eventually left and the rain\nstopped, but the warm feeling inside me lingered for a while. I can still bring\nit back to life sometimes.","src/content/posts/a-kitchen-in-athens.mdx",[27],"@images/a-kitchen-in-athens.jpg","6f505c2b6288a87f",true,"exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens",{"id":30,"data":32,"body":41,"filePath":42,"assetImports":43,"digest":45,"deferredRender":29},{"title":33,"slug":30,"datePublished":34,"excerpt":35,"image":36,"tags":39},"Exploring the Acropolis of Athens","August 14, 2025","That winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost summer heat.

This was\nour first proper visit to Greece's capital, and I felt a little sorry we\ncouldn't have come sooner. Before that, we had a five-hour train ride from\nThessaloniki, during which I worked and read a book. The trip reminded me of my\nchildhood journeys to the countryside with my parents. It felt almost the same\nto take the train and stare aimlessly at the changing landscape. I'm glad that\nsome things never change.\n\n\u003CImageGallery\n  srcLeft={img2}\n  captionLeft=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n  srcRight={img3}\n  captionRight=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n/>\n\nThat winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost\nsummer heat. Since we didn't have much time, we decided to visit the Acropolis,\nhave dinner, and maybe take a short walk around the city center. I don't really\nlike to use the word, but the Acropolis was \"epic.\" I felt pressed down to the\nground by the history of that place. Ancient ruins hold a special place in my\nheart. Even with all the cameras and technology, you can still feel the\natmosphere of distant times around those still marble blocks and statues.\n\nAthens is a huge city. I almost forgot what it feels like to spend an hour or\nmore just to get from point A to point B, and Athens reminded me of that. I\nenjoyed using the metro in Athens. Noisy and overcrowded, it still felt quiet\nand relaxing. Dilapidated bridges over the rails covered with rust and paint,\novergrown walls bathed in sun, and narrow passages and walkways. I don't think\nI've ever seen a place before where nature and technology are so intertwined\nwith the old and neglected.\n\n\u003CImageWithCaption\n  src={img4}\n  alt=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n  caption=\"A view from the Acropolis\"\n/>\n\nA few months later, when my phone finally realized I was in Athens, I started\nreceiving Instagram ads for a bookshop. The atmosphere of these ads was almost\nthe same as the Athens underground: full of sun, stillness, and relaxation. I\nguess next time I visit, I'll have no other choice but to find that bookshop.","src/content/posts/exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens.mdx",[44],"@images/exploring-the-acropolis-of-athens/featured.jpg","fbaf3b49ea091055"]
