That winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost
summer heat. Since we did not have much time, we decided to visit the Acropolis,
have dinner, and maybe take a short walk around the city center.

Just a few hours before we got to our apartment with a
[kitchen](a-kitchen-in-athens), we took a walk in the center of Athens. This was
our first proper visit to Greece's capital, and I felt a little sorry we
couldn't have come sooner. Before that, we had a five-hour train ride from
Thessaloniki, during which I worked and read a book. The trip reminded me of my
childhood journeys to the countryside with my parents. It felt almost the same
to take the train and stare aimlessly at the changing landscape. I'm glad that
some things never change.

That winter in Thessaloniki was quite cold, but Athens greeted us with almost
summer heat. Since we didn't have much time, we decided to visit the Acropolis,
have dinner, and maybe take a short walk around the city center. I don't really
like to use the word, but the Acropolis was "epic." I felt pressed down to the
ground by the history of that place. Ancient ruins hold a special place in my
heart. Even with all the cameras and technology, you can still feel the
atmosphere of distant times around those still marble blocks and statues.

Athens is a huge city. I almost forgot what it feels like to spend an hour or
more just to get from point A to point B, and Athens reminded me of that. I
enjoyed using the metro in Athens. Noisy and overcrowded, it still felt quiet
and relaxing. Dilapidated bridges over the rails covered with rust and paint,
overgrown walls bathed in sun, and narrow passages and walkways. I don't think
I've ever seen a place before where nature and technology are so intertwined
with the old and neglected.

A few months later, when my phone finally realized I was in Athens, I started
receiving Instagram ads for a bookshop. The atmosphere of these ads was almost
the same as the Athens underground: full of sun, stillness, and relaxation. I
guess next time I visit, I'll have no other choice but to find that bookshop.
