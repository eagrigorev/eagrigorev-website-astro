Winter has started in Thessaloniki once again, and it feels so unreal compared
to the place where I used to live for almost my whole life. It will be my fourth
winter in Greece, but I still can't get used to the blue sky and relative warmth
outside. My perception of the temperature, though, changes. I'm getting cold
easier. I'm not used to constant rain anymore. We don't have a lot of
precipitation, though, but even what we have is quite a lot, it feels. I really
like the Christmas mood starting to appear here and there. It doesn't feel
exactly as in my homeland, but I started appreciating what I have. I try to
fixate on small things that boost my mood, and try to accept whatever I get. In
the uncertain world, I guess, this is the only thing we have.
