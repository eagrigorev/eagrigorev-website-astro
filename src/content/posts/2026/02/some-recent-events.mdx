    excerpt:
      'I started taking notes in paper journals in late 2010. At first, it was
      just a small hobby to help me kill time during endless shifts at a
      bookstore cash wrap, but I eventually embraced the habit and expanded from
      random notes to a regular daily journal. I have taken daily notes and
      never missed a day from then until 2025.',
