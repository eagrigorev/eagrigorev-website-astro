I started taking notes in paper journals in late 2010. At first, it was just a
small hobby to help me kill time during endless shifts at a bookstore cash wrap,
but I eventually embraced the habit and expanded from random notes to a regular
daily journal. I've taken daily notes and never missed a day from then
until 2025.

For the first ten years or so, journaling felt like an extension of my life. I
knew exactly what I wanted to write; my notes were thoughtful and long, filled
with daily observations and small details that allowed me to easily recall how I
felt and what I did. My memory even improved. It became significantly easier to
track my life and feel like it was truly happening, rather than just a fever
dream. I was able to stop, look back, and visualize past days as individual
events instead of a vague blur. I think that ability to capture life in all its
strangeness and elusiveness was what I valued most. I still remember some of
those early entries, even though I no longer have access to the physical
diaries.

But then something changed, and one of the most anticipated moments of each day
turned into a chore. Was it that I had become an old, boring person? Unlikely.
Or maybe my days had sped up, filled with nothing but routine? Probably. But I
feel the real reason was the war, which led to a quick, painful departure from
my old life and the deconstruction of old habits. I simply didn't know how to
write about myself anymore. Everything felt meaningless and pointless.

Still, I kept writing for another two years. The entries became shallow. I
started leaving gaps, then painfully tried to reconstruct what had happened and
how I had felt during those missed days. Everything became generic, mundane, and
dull. The largest gap I had, at the end of 2025, was about four months. I
eventually filled it, but I guess it's time to stop beating a dead horse and
move on. I still want to write — it is a part of who I am — but I need to figure
out a new process that suits the person I've become.
