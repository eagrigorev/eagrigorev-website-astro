The new year has started, but unfortunately I don't have any major resolutions.
I made resolutions in the past, but eventually it never worked out, so I decided
to skip this one. Instead of putting pressure on myself and others with
done/undone goals on Instagram, I decided to avoid posting at all. But
nevertheless, something should be said. The last year I traveled a lot,
exercised a lot, read less than I wanted, studied Greek even less than needed,
and doom-scrolled more than any sane human being should. So, for the next year,
I decided to reduce the screen time even more and focus on offline goals. I will
try to read more, exercise more, and travel more. Spend more time writing and
drawing instead of playing games and consuming brainrot content, and putting my
shit together. My life seems to be falling apart, and I don't feel like it is
well organized. Maybe it is time to do something about it.
