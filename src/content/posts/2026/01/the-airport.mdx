Today we had a lot of snow. In a few European countries there even was a
transport collapse, and Hungary, sadly, was not an exception. We spent two extra
hours in the airport and then yet another two hours on a plane. I've never
experienced flight delays before and was quite stressed out. I spent all the
waiting time reading a book. Eventually, we took off, and later landed without
trouble, but uneasiness didn't go away.
