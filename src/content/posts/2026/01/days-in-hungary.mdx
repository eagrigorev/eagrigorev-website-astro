I went to Hungary for the holidays and left my laptop at home. I have been
reading a lot during the last week and finally finished
[_Of Time and the River_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Time_and_the_River)
by Thomas Wolfe, one of my favorite authors. Last year I bought _The Complete
Works_ of him, which is around 6000 pages, and have been reading it in and out
since then. I tend to read when I have nothing to do, and if I start, it becomes
hard to stop: I can read a few hundred pages a day, and then spend weeks not
reading. For 2026, I want to become more consistent: maybe reduce numbers, but
increase frequency. I also did a couple of drawings.

It's quite cold in Hungary now, and I'm not used to such temperatures anymore. I
even saw snow today! Probably, the first proper snow in the last four years. It
feels nice to spend time on offline activities.

When I leave in a few days, I would like to keep that feeling for the entire
year.
