Since returning to Greece, I have been trying to read every day. I have hardly
watched any political or brainrot videos in the last ten days, and it feels
good. On a plane, I started to read _The Book of Tokyo_, which I picked mostly
because it contains one of the previously unread stories by Banana Yoshimoto. I
finished it today with mixed feelings. Though I quite enjoyed the story by
Banana Yoshimoto and a couple of others, most of the author's picks left me
indifferent. I enjoy reading Japanese authors but inevitably compare them to
Haruki Murakami, whom I adore the most. The comparison is often in the favor of
the latter.

It feels great to read every day. Last year I was reading sporadically, and
sometimes it was hard to catch up with a book and remember what it is it all
about. Now I feel more connected to the story, and my brain keeps remembering
things. The reason that I forgot things was the main one when I started writing
diaries 15 years ago. Writing and reading helped me a lot to train my brain in
the early years. Eventually, my reading habits declined and writing also became
more plain. And I really want these things back.
