This year, I read 33 books and discovered 17 new authors.

Ayn Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_ was undeniably the book of the year for me. I
divided it into three parts and read it over three months. I still find myself
thinking about it because it changed something in me. Although I'm not a fan of
Ayn Rand's philosophy, I found her work somewhat aligned with my way of
thinking.

I also realized that audiobooks are not suitable for me because I struggle to
concentrate while listening.
