This year, I read 34 books and discovered nine new authors.

Throughout the year, I did a lot of rereading. I took advantage of reading books
in English and discovered several new authors and out-of-print works by some of
my favorite writers from the past, thanks to my e-reader! I chose _Watership
Down_ by Richard Adams because I've never encountered such a heartwarming,
feels-like-home book with a richly developed world and solid background. Plus, I
love rabbits!
