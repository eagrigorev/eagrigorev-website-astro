This year, I read 15 books and discovered eight new authors.

To be honest, I'm not happy with my reading list this year. I managed to finish
a disappointingly low number of books, although some were quite challenging,
like _Sometimes a Great Notion_. Still, taking three months to finish a book is
unacceptably long! Another book that took me too long to read was _Dubliners_ by
James Joyce, which I thoroughly disliked. Following my rule of not abandoning
boring books, I ended up feeling trapped by my own principles. You know the
situation.
