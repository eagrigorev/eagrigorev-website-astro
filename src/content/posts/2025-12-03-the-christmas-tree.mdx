We bought a Christmas tree. This is probably one of few traditions that we try
to follow no matter what, especially after we left our country and spent six
months in different hotels across the continent. I remember the first winter in
Greece. We were extremely lost and tired of the pilgrimage and general
uncertainty. We had just rented our apartment and desperately needed something
to cling to, something from the "normal life". So we went to the bazaar and
bought a Christmas tree. We didn't plan it out that time and didn't even order
delivery. Ending up with a heavy tree in a bucket that was almost impossible to
lift and carry even for ten meters, we had no other choice but to call a taxi. I
still remember how we've been clinging to "normality" so hard. Now I smile,
remembering that day, but it wasn't that fun getting stuck with a dead-weight
tree in the middle of the night on the street!
