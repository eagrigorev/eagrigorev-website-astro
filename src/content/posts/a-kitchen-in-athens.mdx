In the beginning of the year, my wife and I took a short trip to Athens. It was
only a two-day trip to complete all the formalities for our UK visa application,
but it was our first real trip to Athens in almost three years of living in
Greece. I'll share a few pictures from that trip later.

I remember we had a very cozy and quiet little apartment with a kitchen window
that looked out onto an overgrown and slightly abandoned garden. One day it was
raining, which is common for Greece in the winter, and I was doing dishes in our
quiet little kitchen, looking outside. I saw how the water pelted the leaves and
barrels. I also saw a cat hiding under a staircase and thought that this might
be one of those core memories that stay with you for a lifetime.

I thought about my pilgrimage: how the "me" from 2021 would have never imagined
myself doing household chores in Athens. I grieved all the things I had lost and
all the people who were no longer there.

For the last few years, I've been reading a lot of various small, personal
websites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the internet when
people could create small pieces of the web for themselves, and all the websites
looked authentic and different. I thought it might be a good idea to create
something like that for myself and share things that I do care about and which
are already gone.

I was thinking all these thoughts while doing dishes. The rain was pouring, the
cat was sitting, and all the small, precious things around me and inside my
strange life were connecting to each other. The cat eventually left and the rain
stopped, but the warm feeling inside me lingered for a while. I can still bring
it back to life sometimes.
