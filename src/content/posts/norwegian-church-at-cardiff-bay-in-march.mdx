  'A few months later, in cold and windy Cardiff, Wales, we stumbled upon the
  old Norwegian Church Arts Centre, nestled in the heart of Cardiff Bay. We had
  already navigated the visa acquisition drama, booked our trip, arrived in
  England, and spent a few days in Bath.'

We were pretty tired and cold. After a couple of years living in Greece, our
bodies had adapted to the heat and had forgotten how to handle cold weather. It
might not have even been that cold, but the wind from the bay sent chills
through us. We immediately decided to go inside and warm up for a while.

[Inside](https://www.norwegianchurchcardiff.com/), it was toasty. The barista
was so friendly and the atmosphere so happy that I was instantly transported
back to two trips from my "past life" — one from 11 years ago, and another from
the year after. Both trips held dear, pleasant memories, but they were also
incredibly sad. If I didn't know that a human body completely replaces its cells
every seven to ten years, I wouldn't have believed they had even happened to me.

The first trip, to Finland and Sweden, felt like the beginning of something new
and exciting, but it was actually the end. It took me almost eight years to cope
and reinvent myself from scratch. Though, keeping the seven-year theory in mind,
every cell that had suffered was likely gone, and I was, in a sense, a new
person. I sat on a wooden bench, drinking a coffee, and thinking about the past.
I had only started drinking coffee again a year or so ago, after almost ten
years of abstinence. Honestly, I had hated coffee since that trip, but I learned
to love it again.

The second trip was to Åland. I went alone, just to see what it would feel like
to experience the same conditions again after a whole year of pain. It was a
terrible experience. The trip itself was fine, but I felt awful. I haven't
traveled alone since. Still, I cherish the memories of eating fish soup by the
river at an old fisherman's house and exploring Mariehamn in the evening,
watching a sunrise and a sunset from the top of a hill. I remember going to a
random pub for supper and watching a guy get kicked out for being drunk and
shattering a beer glass. Then, on the steps of a church almost identical to the
one I'd seen the year before, where I'd once thought I was having the best day
of my life, I felt I was having the worst. I cried for all the things I could
have had but had lost, and it felt liberating, even though it wasn't.

A quote on the wall caught my attention. I usually dislike such things, but this
one triggered memories so intensely that I almost cried again. I recalled both
trips with a clarity I usually tended to avoid. I experienced all the emotions
again. It was so strange to feel the same way after more than ten years, but I
was glad that even though I was older, I could still think, feel, and experience
things as before. It meant that the young, silly boy inside me hadn't died or
gone into a dark room but was wandering in the fields instead. This was a
relief, and I'm glad I had that realization and have held onto it.

And then we left. The day was long, we had things to see, and it was still only
morning. God, I was so tired.
