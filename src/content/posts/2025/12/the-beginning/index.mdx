When I first joined the Web some 20 years ago, it was blooming with various
small websites with a soul, a strong feel of the author's presence, and it truly
felt like private personal spaces. Over years, I gradually lost the sensation of
these websites being still present. It feels like they have been pushed back by
bigger platforms with endless engagement. I have really missed these personal
websites throughout the years and thought it might be a good idea to create
something like that for myself and share things that I care about and which
otherwise would be gone.

There are a few posts in my backlog that I haven't decided how to publish yet: I
don't really like the idea of backdating posts, but maybe it would be the only
way. Anyway, this is the beginning, and hopefully it will go well.
