I started to notice recently how badly degraded my mental state, concentration
and attention span. Compared to previous years, it has become significantly
harder to focus on completing tasks, maintaining a routine and hobbies and be
immersed in certain activities for prolonged amounts of time. Lately, all my
efforts are aimed mostly at maintaining the already reached level of expertise
and involvement, rather than on trying to achieve new goals or skill levels.
Instead, I waste all my free time on doom-scrolling and short content
consumption. I will try to focus on reading, hobbies and learning instead and
see if my concentration will improve.

I have also created this website. It works like a digital garden. I have
different topics there, and when I post something, I assign the post to one or
some of them, and they get sorted in chronological order. So each topic is an
evolving thing. I had some posts from the past that I was thinking of posting
too, but eventually I decided to rewrite them.
