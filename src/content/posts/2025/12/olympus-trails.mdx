Yesterday, I went hiking up Mount Olympus. The trail was about ten kilometers
long with 900 meters of elevation gain, most of which occurred in the first two
hours. Everything was shrouded in dense fog, and the humidity was so high that I
even gave up on the idea of using my film camera. For about five hours, I
concentrated on walking — trying not to trip or fall — climbing, and observing.

I felt strangely at peace with myself, which hadn't happened in quite a long
time. No internet, no doom-scrolling, no "brain rot," and no fast distractions.
A random stray dog stuck with us and followed for the duration of the trip,
casually avoiding the dangers of the steep slopes. I thought that this was
possibly the closest I had come to reaching my old self: curious, daring, and
passionate.

For the last few years, I have felt strangely detached and as though I didn't
belong. My previous, comfortable life was destroyed, and my mental state is not
what it used to be. I lost interest in many hobbies and didn't want to progress
in the few that remained. Still, I wanted to be "me" — the real me that got lost
somewhere in the past. I want to climb over tree logs and stumps; I want to
draw; I want to feel like I'm doing something meaningful that brings me comfort.
I want to write in my diaries again, a habit I kept for 15 years but largely
abandoned in 2025.

So, I decided to start this blog to track my progress and reflect on things that
are happening, and have happened, in my life. I want to stay on that hiking
trail for as long as possible. For the last few years, I've been reading various
small, personal websites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the
internet, when people created small pieces of the web for themselves and every
website looked authentic and unique. I thought it might be a good idea to create
something like that for myself—to share the things I care about and those that
are already gone.
