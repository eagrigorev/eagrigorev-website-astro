Before visiting [Cardiff](norwegian-church-at-cardiff-bay-in-march), we went to
the city of Bath, located in Somerset, South West England. After spending a few
days in that beautiful place, we felt like we had finally found a place where we
would like to live and settle down. I feel that the city has established its
place in my heart among others that I love: Helsinki, Kotka, and a few others.
I'd like to focus on a short countryside trip that we took on our second day.

We woke up early and went to a neighboring village, a small and sleepy
settlement with empty, narrow streets, overgrown hedges, and old, beautiful
buildings. Though at first sight some houses looked decrepit, it was clear that
they were tended to and kept as close as possible to how they looked when they
were built. After a walk in the village, we went into the hills. Shrub walls
became higher, hiding farms and livestock, and the air smelled of horses and cut
grass. We ascended the slope uphill and entered the open. The wind picked up,
and I could see foggy ravines and a few sheep here and there. We walked through
the hills for some time but eventually had to turn back.

This was quite an intense emotional experience because, of all the places I've
been, only England looks and feels exactly the way I had imagined it. I thought
about how cool it would be to live in a small village and go up into the hills
every morning while the air is still cold, giving names to sheep and cows,
birdwatching, and drawing landscapes. This could be a future I'd really like to
have.
