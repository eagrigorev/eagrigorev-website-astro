For the last few years, I've been reading a lot of various small, personal
websites and blogs. It brings me back to the beginning of the internet when
people could create small pieces of the web for themselves, and all the websites
looked authentic and different. I thought it might be a good idea to create
something like that for myself and share things that I care about and which are
otherwise gone.

I'm still a little bit unsure how to handle things that I have in my backlog. I
don't want to backdate posts, but maybe at some point I will have to. Probably,
some of my older music and reading journals will be posted in past chronological
order for the sake of preserving the timeline, but this post is definitely the
beginning. I want to document things starting from this exact point.
