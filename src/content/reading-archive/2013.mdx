This year, I read 39 books and discovered ten new authors.

It was a relatively calm year. I changed jobs and focused on settling into the
new role. My reading lacked a specific system; I revisited Haruki Murakami,
explored some previously unreleased works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and tackled
two substantial books by Ernst Jünger. It was a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose.
