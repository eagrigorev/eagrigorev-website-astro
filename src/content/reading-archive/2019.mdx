This year, I read 66 books and discovered 19 new authors.

I finally completed nearly all of Yukio Mishima's works, which I had long wanted
to read. Additionally, back in 2019, I set a rule to discover at least one or
two new authors each month, and I've already found some excellent ones for my
collection! The most significant discovery this year, without a doubt, was
Jonathan Coe. I've wanted to read his books ever since I worked at our local
bookstore nearly ten years ago.
