This year, I read 20 books and discovered seven new authors.

2015 was the year of _Ulysses_ by James Joyce for me. I spent almost four months
reading it, fulfilling a desire I'd had for nearly ten years. Although I didn't
enjoy the book due to its extreme tediousness, I'm glad to have finally closed
that chapter. Another book was _The Pope's Rhinoceros_ by Lawrence Norfolk,
which I also didn't enjoy. This book has its own story: I bought it five years
ago and never got around to reading it. It just sat on my bookshelf, forgotten.
Now, that chapter is also closed for good!
