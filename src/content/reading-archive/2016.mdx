This year, I read 21 books and discovered seven new authors.

I finally managed to read _The Past is a Foreign Country_ by David Lowenthal, a
book I had wanted to read for at least five years. Lying in bed, reading, and
reflecting on various memories and emotions from my past, I felt like something
clicked in my mind, making it easier to think about certain parts of my life.
I'm also completely happy with the new series by Макс Фрай, which is unfolding
before my eyes.
