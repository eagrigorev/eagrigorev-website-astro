This year, I read 141 books and discovered 25 new authors.

It was a chaotic year! I was sick a lot and spent six to eight hours each day
reading, devouring one book after another. I also reread a lot of familiar
works, like those by Макс Фрай, Haruki Murakami, and others. While I discovered
several new authors, that wasn't my main goal. Given the numerous challenges I
faced this year, I wanted to revisit my all-time favorite books and keep their
memories fresh in my mind.
