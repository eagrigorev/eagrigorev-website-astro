I'm a frontend software developer at T-Digital by Deutsche Telekom, based in
Thessaloniki, Greece. Before this, I worked for 10 years as a military engineer,
and prior to that, as a bookseller. I love clean and minimal interfaces,
accessible homemade and local applications, and digital gardens.

I received my master's degree in Automation and Engineering in 2010 from Baltic
State Technological University of Saint Petersburg, where I was born and lived
my entire life. Over the years, I began to burn out on engineering, while
simultaneously developing a growing interest in web development. This interest
eventually led me to start learning software development during the COVID years.
In 2022, I moved to Turkey, then to Latvia, and later to Greece, where I landed
my first IT job.

I love hiking, calisthenics, drawing, playing guitar, and reading. I also enjoy
film photography.
