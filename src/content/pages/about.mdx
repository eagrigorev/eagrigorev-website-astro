I spent 10 years as a military engineer and, prior to that, worked as a
bookseller. Then I transitioned into software development. I like clean and
minimal interfaces, accessible web applications, and digital gardens.

I was born in Saint Petersburg and received my master's degree in Automation and
Engineering in 2010 from Baltic State Technological University. Over the years,
I began to burn out on engineering as my interest in web development grew. This
led me to start studying software development during the COVID years. In 2022, I
moved to Turkey, then to Latvia, and later to Greece, where I landed my first IT
job.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, calisthenics, drawing, playing guitar, reading,
and film photography.
