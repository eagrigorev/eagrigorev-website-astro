This year, I read 27 books and discovered 14 new authors.

I made an effort to discover as many new authors as possible and was pleased
with almost all of them. Self-isolation led me to focus primarily on digital
books, so I've continued using my e-reader. I can hardly remember if I even
visited our local bookstore once!
