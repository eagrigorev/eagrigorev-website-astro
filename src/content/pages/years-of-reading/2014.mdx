This year, I read 23 books and discovered 14 new authors.

I would say that 2014 was the year of non-fiction literature for me. At the same
time, I discovered another great author whom I loved instantly. _Isle of Dreams_
by Keizo Hino has become one of my all-time favorites. I also finished _The
Magic Mountain_ by Thomas Mann, a book I had wanted to read since I started
working at our local bookstore in 2009.
