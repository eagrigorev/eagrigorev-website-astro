I began filling in the blank pages on May 14, the day I turned 23. With
absolutely no idea where this journey might take me, I patiently kept everything
in one place. I don't have a specific goal regarding the number, quality, or
quantity of books; I believe it's better to simply read and enjoy the process as
much as possible.
