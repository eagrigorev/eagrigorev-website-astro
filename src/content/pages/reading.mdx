I started to track my reading progress in 2010 for no particular reason while I
was working in a local book store. Somehow it turned into a habit, and now I'm
patiently recording all the books for the sake of tradition. I have no specific
goal. Let it be just a part of my history.

[2010](reading/2010) → [2011](reading/2011) → [2012](reading/2012) →
[2013](reading/2013) → [2014](reading/2014) → [2015](reading/2015) →
[2016](reading/2016) → [2017](reading/2017) → [2018](reading/2018) →
[2019](reading/2019) → [2020](reading/2020) → [2021](reading/2021) →
[2022](reading/2022) → [2023](reading/2023) → [2024](reading/2024) →
[2025](reading/2025) → 2026
