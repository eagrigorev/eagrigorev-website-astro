I started to notice recently how badly degraded my mental state, concentration
and attention span. Compared to previous years, it has become significantly
harder to focus on completing tasks, maintaining a routine and hobbies and be
immersed in certain activities for prolonged amounts of time. Lately, all my
efforts are aimed mostly at maintaining the already reached level of expertise
and involvement, rather than on trying to achieve new goals or skill levels.
Instead, I waste all my free time on doom-scrolling and short content
consumption. Starting from yesterday, I removed all the sources of brain rot
from immediate access. I will try to focus on reading, hobbies and learning
instead and see if my concentration will improve.
